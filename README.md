<h1> Patrick-Lai-Fang-WDI16 Project 1 Connect Four</h1>

<p>This project is my version of Connect Four. I decided to challenge myself by choosing one of the harder ones because of one of the quotes on the wall in GA:

<h2>"Do one thing every day that SCARES You." - Eleanor Roosevelt</h2>

This choice as a Project 1 scares me and I am willing to accept the challenge and prove myself. I figure, if I can get through this project and complete it, my mindset about the remainder of our projects will be in the right place. I now have a better understanding of the frustration of wanting to get something you put together to work and also accomplishing getting it to work. I did not get everything in my Icebox accomplished, but I have time to continue to work on this project as I brush up on my skills through this course. There was a time at some point where I crashed my computer, due to an ifinite loop, but I didnt let that set me back as far as I could have. From this experience, I now know that the styling can come last if I figure out the logic of my site first. I hope you enjoy what I have so far! Keep checking back as I will continue to make improvements throughout my course and career as a Web Developer.</p>
