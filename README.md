<h1> Patrick-Lai-Fang-WDI16 Project 1 Connect Four</h1>
This project is my version of Connect Four. I decided to challenge myself by choosing one of the harder ones because of one of the quotes on the wall in GA:

"Do one thing every day that SCARES You." - Eleanor Roosevelt

This choice as a Project 1 scares me and I am willing to accept the challenge and prove myself. I figure, if I can get through this prject and complete it, the other projects will be just like this one. Which means I will be able to complete them.
